ICARO
=====

This is the top level of the ICARO repository. Different analysis belong here. The recommended organization is one folder per analysis (e.g, NA-22, Co-56, Krypton, bb2nu...). Additional folders can be created inside the specific analysis folders if needed. In addition to analysis folders, a /cities directory contains documentation NBs from IC cities and a /calib directory contains calibration NBs and source code.
